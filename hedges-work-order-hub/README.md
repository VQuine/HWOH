A normal part of running an apartment complex is handling residents requesting maintenance or repairs. Requests vary greatly and can range from property damage, to major appliance malfunctions; to burnt out light bulbs and beeping smoke alarms. Complex workers are assigned daily odd jobs, finding solutions to individualized challenges is key. Keeping record of these interactions and problem solving assignments is critical to keeping track of apartments, tenants, and their repairs.

This application is meant to be an easily accessible, central location for staff members of apartment complex properties to report and deal with Work Orders, along with the Tenants wanting to file them. The database handles organization of Building/Apartment addresses through Tenant assignment and finds Work Orders based on who requested them.
